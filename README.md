A fun and educational **Python practice project** that explores a variety of fundamental programming concepts — from data structures and functions to file handling and sets. This project collects small, useful snippets demonstrating key Python techniques and serves as a great learning reference or sandbox for beginners.

## 📘 Overview

The `main.py` file contains multiple self-contained Python examples covering:

- ✅ **Data Structures:** Lists, Sets, Dictionaries, and Tuples  
- 🔁 **Loops & Conditions:** Iteration, filtering, and condition-based logic  
- 🧮 **Functions & Return Values:** Modularizing logic into reusable components  
- 📂 **File Handling:** Reading, writing, appending, and analyzing text files  
- 🧠 **Algorithm Practice:** Simple exercises on frequency counting, intersection, and pattern-based logic  

The `sample.txt` file is used for demonstrating file I/O operations.

## 🧩 Features

- 🔹 Work with **sets** to find intersections, unions, and unique elements  
- 🔹 Identify and remove **duplicate frequencies** from tuples/lists  
- 🔹 Count **lines, words, and letters** in a text file  
- 🔹 Practice **file read/write modes** (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.)  
- 🔹 Implement **basic mathematical functions** and small algorithms  
- 🔹 Learn by **experimenting with commented examples**
